## Introduction

This repository contains automation tests for Demoblaze.com, an e-commerce web application. The tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

## Features

- Automated UI tests for critical user flows.
- Easy setup and execution with Node.js.
- Extensible test suite with examples.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14 or higher) installed on your machine.
- npm (v6 or higher) installed on your machine.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/demoblaze-playwright-tests.git
    cd demoblaze-playwright-tests
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running Tests

To execute the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```


To run tests with a specific browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit):

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example.spec.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- `tests/`: Directory containing all test files.
- `playwright.config.js`: Configuration file for Playwright.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Lockfile for project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Writing Tests

To add new tests, create a `.spec.js` file in the `tests` directory. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('should display correct title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://www.demoblaze.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('STORE');
});
```

Refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for more details on writing tests.
